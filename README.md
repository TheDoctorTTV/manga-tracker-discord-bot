## Overview

Manga Tracker is an open-source Discord bot designed to help manga enthusiasts stay up-to-date with their favorite manga directly from [MangaDex](https://www.mangadex.org/). With Manga Tracker, users can track their favorite manga titles and receive updates conveniently through their DMs.

## Features

- Track any manga listed on MangaDex.
- Receive daily updates at **5 PM UTC** in your DMs about new chapters for your tracked manga.
- Easily add, remove, or list tracked manga through slash commands.
- Export and import your tracked manga list to/from JSON files.

## Commands

| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/checkupdates` | Manually check for updates on tracked manga.   |
| `/version`      | Display the current version of the bot.        |
| `/addmanga`     | Add a manga to your tracking list.             |
